# MM-RAG
## Overview
This repository will host the code (both Python files and Jupyter notebooks) that I will be using to experiment with an RAG & AI-powered chatbot system that allows the user to upload detailed organization data in a multimodal format. The uploaded data will be converted into vector embeddings to implement RAG.
